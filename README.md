FAKE REVIEW DETECTION SYSTEM 

Developed a machine learning model which can predict whether an online review is fraudulent or not. The main idea used to detect the fake nature of reviews is that the review should be computer generated through unfair means. If the review is created manually, then it is considered legal and original.
Main task is to detect whether a given review is fraudulent or not. If it is computer generated, it is considered fake otherwise not.
The generated fake reviews dataset, containing 20k fake reviews and 20k real product reviews.


PROBLEM STATEMENT

Detection of fake reviews out of a dataset of reviews with each review having a corresponding rating, label ie. CG (Computer Generated Review) and OR (Original Review generated by humans) and the review text.


GOAL

Main task is to detect whether a given review is fraudulent or not. If it is computer generated, it is considered fake otherwise not.

DataSet

1. Publicly Available Data:
The dataset for this project was assembled using publicly available review data from various platforms. Efforts were made to ensure that the dataset contains a mix of genuine and fake reviews for effective training and testing.

2. Collected from the Web:
For this project, review data was collected from various websites across the web. The dataset was compiled to include a diverse range of reviews to help train and test our fake review detection system.

3. Compiled from Multiple Sources:
The dataset used in this project was compiled from multiple sources available online. It includes a variety of reviews to provide a comprehensive base for training our detection system.

4. Anonymous Data Sources:
The dataset for this project was sourced from various anonymous online platforms. The aim was to gather a wide range of review samples to ensure the robustness of our fake review detection system.
